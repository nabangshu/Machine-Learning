# Machine-Learning

This repo contains some of my code in Machine Learning. I am in the process of finding my old code, and uploading it here.

The .cpp files were assignments in my Machine Learning course. I implemented these in C++ for obtaining higher speed.

Iterated_FGSM and TF2_FGSM are contain the FGSM adversarial attack in Tensorflow 1.0 and Tensorflow 2.0, respectively.

Vanilla_Extreme contains the code for the vanilla version of Extreme Learning Machines.
